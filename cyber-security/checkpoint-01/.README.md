# Cyber-Security - Checkpoint 01

"Fight the terrorism" is an academic project to identify if an emigrant is or not a terrorist. Based on emigrant's
personal information such as name and/or passport, an API is consulted to match with the provided information. If a
match is found, the emigrant will be accused as terrorist.

- UI built with [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- The API is hosted on Github as static json file and consumed with Python `requests` package
- Input validation with Regex
- Text comparison, to match names, based on [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
  using [TheFuzz](https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz) Python library
